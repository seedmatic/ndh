# Bioskop Package Variants

This directory captures everything needed to compose Bioskop’s downstream manifests:

- `Kptfile` + `bioskop-setters.yaml` contain shared values that flow into every cloned catalog package.
- `packages.yaml` lists the catalog packages that must be mirrored into the downstream repo (see comments for what each component provides).
- `DEPLOYMENT-ORDER.md` defines the order in which the rendered packages should be applied on the cluster.

After running `kpt pkg get` for each entry in `packages.yaml`, the downstream repo will have `packagevariants/bioskop/cluster/<category>/<package>` directories ready for `kpt fn render`.
